##  Problem Statement
Unfortunately, over time, violence against the fair sex has been intensified which resulted in an obstacle for them to prosper and grow equitably. Women comprise more than 48% of the population of Pakistan which is nearly half of this state. But due to some conventions and annoying happenings, they are not able to take part in activities as much as men.

##  Inspiration & Motivation
The thing that inspired me to work for women’s empowerment was their capability to perform and deliver, they are as important as men. I as a student, and part of families wanted to contribute to creating a beneficial cause of empowering women and to give them a tap on the shoulder to keep going and not give up!

For this, I developed a mobile application named **Rakshikha**

It is a mobile application developed specifically for women. That lets them take a leap that they can count on someone and we made sure that “SOMEONE” will be none other but their own contacts which they can send alerts, locations, and much more.





## Features
Following are the features available in Rakshikha:

- Secure Authentication
- Emergency SOS Button
- Send Message to your selected Contacts with your current location
- Helpline nummbers to contact nearest police stations, hospitals, fire brigade, pharmacies etc
- Posts section where you can share your Experience 
- Tips section for Women Safety and empowerment.

## Features in Future
- **Safe Audio**: Enable user's device audio for recording, that could be used as an evidence by respective department (e.g Police).
- **Scream Detection**: Detecting Loud voice and Screams to Help in Emergency.
- **Danger Zone Detection** : Using ML model to predict danger rate of a location based on past Crime data.
- **Overcome SMS Charges**: We want to overcome the charges we required to send the SOS SMS in future in collaboration with our Government hopefully.


##  Tools & Technology
